# challenge-card-game-becode
First Solo project at Becode

The card deck program project is a practice to demonstrate my knowledge of basic python and advance python.

This game is built with five classes name: Symbol , Card, Player, Deck and Board.

The symbol class main functions was to convert the icons which is in form of list to string.

The Card class was used to create the individual card

The player class was used to create the behavior of each player

The Deck class was used to create the total card that would be used for the game.
